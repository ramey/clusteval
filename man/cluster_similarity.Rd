\title{Computes the similarity between two clusterings of the same data set.}
\usage{
cluster_similarity(labels1, labels2, similarity = "adjusted_rand")
}
\arguments{
\item{labels1}{a vector of \code{n} clustering labels}

\item{labels2}{a vector of \code{n} clustering labels}

\item{similarity}{the similarity statistic to calculate. See
\code{\link{similarity_methods}} for a listing of available similarity
methods. By default, the adjusted Rand index is used.}
}
\value{
the similarity between the two clusterings
}
\description{
For two clusterings of the same data set, this function calculates the 
similarity statistic specified of the clusterings from the comemberships of
the observations. Basically, the comembership is defined as the pairs of
observations that are clustered together.
}
\details{
To calculate the similarity, we compute the 2x2 contingency table, consisting
of the following four cells:
\describe{
  \item{n_11:}{the number of observation pairs where both observations are
comembers in both clusterings}
  \item{n_10:}{the number of observation pairs where the observations are
comembers in the first clustering but not the second}
  \item{n_01:}{the number of observation pairs where the observations are
comembers in the second clustering but not the first}
  \item{n_00:}{the number of observation pairs where neither pair are comembers
in either clustering}
}

Currently, we have implemented the following similarity statistics:
\itemize{
  \item Adjusted Rand index
  \item Dice coefficient
  \item Fowlkes-Mallows coefficient
  \item Jaccard coefficient
  \item Phi coefficient
  \item Rand index
  \item Rogers-Tanimoto coefficient
  \item Russel-Rao coefficient
  \item Sokal-Sneath coefficient
}

To compute the contingency table, we use the \code{\link{comembership_table}}
function.

\examples{
# Notice that the number of comemberships is 'n choose 2'.
iris_kmeans <- kmeans(iris[, -5], centers = 3)$cluster
iris_hclust <- cutree(hclust(dist(iris[, -5])), k = 3)
cluster_similarity(iris_kmeans, iris_hclust)
