\title{Generates random variates from multivariate normal populations with intraclass
covariance matrices.}
\usage{
sim_normal(n = rep(25, 5), p = 50, rho = rep(0.9, 5), delta = 0,
  sigma2 = 1, seed = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{n}{a vector (of length K_0) of the sample sizes for each population}

\item{p}{the dimension of the multivariate normal populations}

\item{rho}{a vector (of length K_0) of the intraclass constants for each
population}

\item{delta}{the fixed distance between each population and the origin}

\item{sigma2}{the coefficient of each intraclass covariance matrix}

\item{seed}{seed for random number generation (If \code{NULL}, does not set
seed)}
}
\value{
named list containing:
\describe{
  \item{x:}{A matrix whose rows are the observations generated and whose
  columns are the \code{p} features (variables)}
  \item{y:}{A vector denoting the population from which the observation in
  each row was generated.}
}
}
\description{
We generate \eqn{n_k} observations \eqn{(k = 1, \ldots, K_0)} from each of
\eqn{K_0} multivariate normal distributions such that the Euclidean distance
between each of the means and the origin is equal and scaled by
\eqn{\Delta \ge 0}.
}
\details{
Let \eqn{\Pi_k} denote the \eqn{k}th population with a \eqn{p}-dimensional
multivariate normal distribution, \eqn{N_p(\mu_k, \Sigma_k)} with mean vector
\eqn{\mu_k} and covariance matrix \eqn{\Sigma_k}. Also, let \eqn{e_k} be the
\eqn{k}th standard basis vector (i.e., the \eqn{k}th element is 1 and the
remaining values are 0). Then, we define \deqn{\mu_k = \Delta
\sum_{j=1}^{p/K_0} e_{(p/K_0)(k-1) + j}.} Note that \eqn{p} must be divisible
by \eqn{K_0}. By default, the first 10 dimensions of \eqn{\mu_1} are set to
\eqn{\Delta} with all remaining dimensions set to 0, the second 10 dimensions
of \eqn{\mu_2} are set to \eqn{\Delta} with all remaining dimensions set to
0, and so on.

Also, we consider intraclass covariance (correlation) matrices such that
\eqn{\Sigma_k = \sigma^2 (1 - \rho_k) J_p + \rho_k I_p}, where
\eqn{-(p-1)^{-1} < \rho_k < 1}, \eqn{I_p} is the \eqn{p \times p} identity
matrix, and \eqn{J_p} denotes the \eqn{p \times p} matrix of ones.

By default, we let \eqn{K_0 = 5}, \eqn{\Delta = 0}, and \eqn{\sigma^2 = 1}.
Furthermore, we generate 25 observations from each population by default.

For \eqn{\Delta = 0} and \eqn{\rho_k = \rho}, \eqn{k = 1, \ldots, K_0}, the
\eqn{K_0} populations are equal.
