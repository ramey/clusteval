\usage{
sim_student(n = rep(25, 5), p = 50, df = rep(6, 5), delta = 0,
  Sigma = diag(p), seed = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{n}{a vector (of length M) of the sample sizes for each population}

\item{p}{the dimension of the multivariate Student's t distributions}

\item{df}{a vector (of length M) of the degrees of freedom for each population}

\item{delta}{the fixed distance between each population and the origin}

\item{Sigma}{the common covariance matrix}

\item{seed}{seed for random number generation (If NULL, does not set seed)}
}
\value{
named list containing:
\describe{
  \item{x:}{A matrix whose rows are the observations generated and whose
  columns are the \code{p} features (variables)}
  \item{y:}{A vector denoting the population from which the observation in
  each row was generated.}
}
}
\description{
We generate \eqn{n_k} observations \eqn{(k = 1, \ldots, K_0)} from each of
\eqn{K_0} multivariate Student's t distributions such that the Euclidean
distance between each of the means and the origin is equal and scaled by
\eqn{\Delta \ge 0}.
}
\details{
Let \eqn{\Pi_k} denote the \eqn{k}th population with a \eqn{p}-dimensional
multivariate Student's t distribution, \eqn{T_p(\mu_k, \Sigma_k, c_k)}, where
\eqn{\mu_k} is the population location vector, \eqn{\Sigma_k} is the
positive-definite covariance matrix, and \eqn{c_k} is the degrees of freedom.

Let \eqn{e_k} be the \eqn{m}th standard basis vector (i.e., the \eqn{k}th
element is 1 and the remaining values are 0). Then, we define \deqn{\mu_k =
\Delta \sum_{j=1}^{p/K_0} e_{(p/K_0)(k-1) + j}.} Note that \eqn{p} must be
divisible by \eqn{K_0}. By default, the first 10 dimensions of \eqn{\mu_1}
are set to \eqn{\Delta} with all remaining dimensions set to 0, the second 10
dimensions of \eqn{\mu_2} are set to \eqn{\Delta} with all remaining
dimensions set to 0, and so on.

We use a common covariance matrix \eqn{\Sigma_k = \Sigma} for all populations.

For small values of \eqn{c_k}, the tails are heavier, and, therefore, the
average number of outlying observations is increased.

By default, we let \eqn{K_0 = 5}, \eqn{\Delta = 0}, \eqn{\Sigma_k = I_p}, and
\eqn{c_k = 6}, \eqn{k = 1, \ldots, K_0}, where \eqn{I_p} denotes the
\eqn{p \times p} identity matrix. Furthermore, we generate 25 observations
from each population by default.

For \eqn{\Delta = 0} and \eqn{c_k = c}, \eqn{k = 1, \ldots, K_0}, the \eqn{K_0}
populations are equal.
